# TypeScript React Express with Webpack

Starter code for a web application using TypeScript, React, Express, and Webpack.

Uses React Router for routing. Uses Semantic UI React for styling.

Note: ``@types/jest`` and ``ts-jest`` are at version 24.0.0 due to bugs in using the most up-to-date versions of the packages.
